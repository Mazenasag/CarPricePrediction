# Car Price Prediction Project

This project utilizes Jupyter Notebook and Spyder IDE to build a car price prediction model using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to develop a system that can accurately predict the price of a car based on various features.

## Project Structure

- `data`: This folder contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `notebooks`: This folder contains Jupyter Notebook files for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `src`: This folder contains the source code files for the car price prediction model.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.
